        bio: 'After finishing my Telecommunications Engineering B.S., I started working as a presales engineer for Big Data & AI products at a Google Cloud partner. After a couple of years in that role, I was selected in 2021 to work as a Cloud Consultant at Google Cloud Professional Services. I started working on Data and AI projects, and quickly transitioned to fully AI. '

        bio: 'Since then, I\'ve been leading AI projects for big enterprises, cross-industry and at the EMEA level. My AI Consultant role could be seen as a "Technical Project Manager" one: I get to craft a plan for each project, and then make sure everything goes smoothly on time, on budget, and most importantly, that our customers are happy. I also get to work with an amazing team of Google Engineers, and I\'m the one who makes sure everyone\'s tasks are clear and that our engineers are supported when they need it, so that we can make sure the project is a success. When I can, I also like to get stuck in with the hands-on side of things, like designing AI architectures, implementing proof of concepts, developing experiments, training models, building GenAI solutions, designing components in an MLOps platform, and leading technical sessions. In short, I have a proven track record of taking complex technical challenges and turning them into innovative AI solutions for big enterprises. What I enjoy the most is stakeholder management and bridging the gap between technology and business. I thrive in dynamic environments, leading cross-functional teams to deliver innovative AI strategies.'

        bio: 'In early 2025, I transitioned into an Outbound Product Manager role at Google Cloud\'s Vertex AI platform, where I\'m now shaping our narrative and go-to-market strategy. My focus spans two key areas: crafting compelling technical and commercial narratives around our unified Data & AI platform (particularly around the Vertex AI and BigQuery services), and driving adoption of our notebooks ecosystem including Vertex Workbench and Colab Enterprise. As an OPM, I lead large-scale communication initiatives, enable our field teams, conduct strategic customer workshops, and translate market research into actionable insights. What excites me most is the opportunity to bridge customer needs with product strategyâ€”I analyze customer success stories, market trends, and GTM feedback to influence product decisions and ensure our solutions truly address real-world challenges. This role perfectly combines my technical background with my passion for stakeholder management and strategic thinking.'
