        bio: 'After finishing my Telecommunications Engineering B.S., I started working as a presales engineer for Big Data & AI products at a Google Cloud partner. After a couple of years in that role, I was selected in 2021 to work as a Cloud Consultant at Google Cloud Professional Services. I started working on Data and AI projects, and quickly transitioned to fully AI. Since then, I\'ve been leading AI projects for big enterprises, cross-industry and at the EMEA level. This means I have a proven track record of taking complex technical challenges and turning them into innovative AI solutions for big enterprises. I really enjoy stakeholder management and bridging the gap between technology and business. I thrive in dynamic environments, leading cross-functional teams to deliver innovative AI strategies.'
